# Tea Cozy
This mini project is from Codecademy's Flexbox Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy.

They provided a design spec and image assets to create a fictional tea shop website. I added my own little details.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML & CSS

I really wanted to focus solely on working with Flexbox and all it's different properties. Although the page is simple and static, I really enjoyed getting to experiement with nesting containers within each other. I feel much more confident using Flexbox for my layouts and have a better understanding of how I will be able to build up more complex layouts in the future. I plan on revisiting this mini project to make it responsive for both tablets and mobile phones.
